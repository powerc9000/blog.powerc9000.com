<p>I was interested in how to make a gravity simulation so then I did. Of course it doesnt use the same gravitational constant that earth does I just did something that worked.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/powerc9000/8uH32/embedded/result/">http://jsfiddle.net/powerc9000/8uH32/embedded/result/</a> is where you can check it out press up and down to speed up or slow down time.</p>

<p>I think I may turn this into a full fleged project because I also want to work with a camera that can zoom in and out I think that would be cool. add in more planets and bodies to make things fun and stufff!</p>
